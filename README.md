Introduction to Data Science @ FGV

Instructor: [Renato Rocha Souza](http://emap.fgv.br/corpo-docente/renato-rocha-souza)

This will be the repository of code for the Introduction to Data Science discipline.

This class is about the Data Science process, in which we seek to gain useful predictions and insights from data. 
Through real-world examples and code snippets, we introduce methods for:

+ data munging, scraping, sampling andcleaning in order to get an informative, manageable data set;
+ data storage and management in order to be able to access data (even if big data);
+ exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate hypotheses and intuition about the data;
+ prediction based on statistical learning tools;
+ communication of results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries
